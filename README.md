# What is optoctreeparser?

This is a C++ library that allows you to work with `.optoctrees` (as well as `.optoctreepatch` for the [TerrainPatcher](https://github.com/Esper89/Subnautica-TerrainPatcher/tree/master) mod) landscape files in the game Subnautica. It can:
- Read and write `.optoctrees` and `.optoctreepatch` in binary format
- Decode octrees into convenient structures from binary format and encode them back
- Find the difference between two batches to form `.optoctreepatch`
